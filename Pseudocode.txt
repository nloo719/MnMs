Let player set parameters: days, stress, exam frequency
Go through each day and randomize events
Check if stress = 100. End game if so.
Check if stress is high (70) or low.
  If low, run "low stress" chances
  Otherwise, run "high stress" changes
  For each day of high stress, increase bad event odds by 5%
    Eliminate good events entirely by 2nd consecutive day of bad stress
If randomizer is in range of event, run event. Otherwise, present choice UI

Each day, give players choices. Ask for input
For each day that they are in high stress, their chances of getting a bad event increase by 5%
